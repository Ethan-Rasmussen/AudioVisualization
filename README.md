This code was created to operate a tetrahedral array of sensors driven by some sort of microcontroller that can operate quickly enough to return 
a microsecond value for the time at which each of 4 sesnors was triggered

Included in this code repository is at minimum, the code needed to implement this funciton with an Arduino Due connected to pins 2345 for the sensor
pins, or with a Raspberry Pi Pico using pins 2345

The main software is designed to be run on the latest model of Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, as of May 2023

The primary purrpuse of this software is to try and extract sound source localization data from our system interation with the sensors.

The enabling features of this project are the methodologies for sensor operation and calibration, and the physical advatage
gained through our clever sesnor array design which can eaxtend the arms of the tetrahedron up to about 3 feet, in optimal conditions.

This project was carried out by Ben Morse, Ethan Rasmussen, and Bailey Wessels throughout the fall of 2022 and into May of 2023
The project was sponsored by Dr Kwanghee Won with South Dakota State University Electrical engineering and Computer Science

->This project part of a proposed ongoing research, any future researchers on behalf of SDSU are welcome to contact the creators
    with the help of SDSU Compoter Science and EE staff Members.
