This program is designed to work with 4 sound sensors connected to an Arduino microcontroller. It records the time of arrival of sound detected by each sensor and sends 
the recorded times over the serial connection when all four sensors have received a sound input. The program utilizes external interrupts and direct port manipulation 
for optimized performance. The data is transmitted in CSV format where each row represents a set of readings from the sensors, and the columns are the sensor IDs and 
their respective time of arrival values in microseconds.

The program can be used for various applications such as sound localization, acoustic source identification, or time difference of arrival estimation in various systems 
like robotics, security, or environmental monitoring. The program can be modified to change the pin connections, data format, or the number of sensors.

To implement a timeout feature, you can add a timer that starts when the first sensor is triggered. If the timer reaches a certain threshold before all four 
sensors are triggered, it can reset the sensors and start over. Additionally, you can add a check to detect if one or more sensors failed to trigger and 
notify the user or take corrective action. To implement these features, you can add additional global variables to track the timer value and the number 
of sensors triggered. Then, modify the sensorXInterrupt() functions to update the sensor count and reset the timer. Finally, modify the loop() function 
to check the sensor count and timer value and take appropriate action.

Here is an example of how to modify the sensorXInterrupt() function to update the sensor count and reset the timer:

volatile uint32_t sensorCount = 0;
volatile uint32_t startTime = 0;
volatile uint32_t timeout = 1000000; // 1 second timeout

void sensor1Interrupt()
{
  if (sensor1Active) {
    sensor1Value = micros();
    sensor1Active = false;
    *portInputRegister(digitalPinToPort(sensor1Pin)) &= ~sensor1BitMask;
    sensorCount++;
    startTime = micros();
  }
}

void sensor2Interrupt()
{
  if (sensor2Active) {
    sensor2Value = micros();
    sensor2Active = false;
    *portInputRegister(digitalPinToPort(sensor2Pin)) &= ~sensor2BitMask;
    sensorCount++;
    startTime = micros();
  }
}

void sensor3Interrupt()
{
  if (sensor3Active) {
    sensor3Value = micros();
    sensor3Active = false;
    *portInputRegister(digitalPinToPort(sensor3Pin)) &= ~sensor3BitMask;
    sensorCount++;
    startTime = micros();
  }
}

void sensor4Interrupt()
{
  if (sensor4Active) {
    sensor4Value = micros();
    sensor4Active = false;
    *portInputRegister(digitalPinToPort(sensor4Pin)) &= ~sensor4BitMask;
    sensorCount++;
    startTime = micros();
  }

Here is an example of how to modify the loop() function to check the sensor count and timer value and take appropriate action:

scss
Copy code
void loop() {
  if (sensorCount == 4) {
    String dataString = String(sensor1Value) + "," + String(sensor2Value) + "," + String(sensor3Value) + "," + String(sensor4Value) + "\n";
    Serial.print(dataFormat);
    Serial.print(dataString);
    resetTimers();
  } else if (micros() - startTime > timeout) {
    resetTimers();
    Serial.println("Timeout: One or more sensors failed to trigger.");
  }
}

These modifications add a 1-second timeout feature and a check to detect if one or more sensors failed to trigger. 
The program resets the sensors and starts over if the timeout is reached before all four sensors are triggered. 
If one or more sensors fail to trigger, the program prints an error message to the serial monitor.

You can adjust the value of the timeout variable to set the timeout duration. If you want to add additional sensors, 
you can modify the sensorCount variable and add additional if statements to check the count. Additionally, you can 
modify the program to take different actions depending on the number of sensors triggered or the cause of the timeout.

Overall, these modifications add a timeout and error detection feature to the program, which can improve its reliability in certain scenarios.
